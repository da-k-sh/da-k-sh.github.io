    <h1>Daksh Pandey</h1>
    <p><em>3rd year Undergrad Student majoring in Engineering Physics with Minor in Mathematics and Computing</em></p>

    <p>I'm an undergraduate student building my research interests around pure and abstract mathematics, approaching modern-world problems from first principles. I'm currently invested in <strong>secure computation</strong> and <strong>cryptanalysis</strong>, with a focus on <strong>Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)</strong>, <strong>Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)</strong>, and <strong>Multi-Party Computation (MPC)</strong>.</p>

    <p>Alongside this, concerned about the high energy usage of the AI revolution, I research and study <strong>high-performance, energy-efficient computing architectures</strong> for secure computation and AI, with <strong>hardware-level security—microarchitectural design, side-channel attacks, and fault injection</strong>, firmly in mind</p>

    <p>In my free time, I play guitar and study music, with a soft spot for jazz, funk, prog, and punk.</p>
